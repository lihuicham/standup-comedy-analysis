       "'Hey, how\\'s it going, folks? I recently went on a blind date, and it was an experience. The guy showed up wearing a fedora and carrying a cane, which was odd because he wasn\\'t blind. I think he was going for a 1920s gangster look or something. But I was willing to give him a chance.  So, we went to a restaurant, and he ordered for me, which was sweet. But then he ordered the most expensive thing on the menu, and I was like, \"Dude, I don\\'t know you like that.\" I mean, I appreciate a fancy dinner, but I\\'m not trying to go into debt on a first date.  Then he started telling me about his job, and it turned out he was a professional mime. I didn\\'t even know that was a thing. I asked him how he got into it, and he just mimed a ladder and climbed it. So, I guess he\\'s always been a bit of a clown.  The conversation was getting a bit awkward, so I decided to break the tension with a joke. I said, \"Why did the mime cross the road?\" And he just stood there, staring at me. And I was like, \"To get to the other side, but silently.\" It was a terrible joke, but I thought it would at least get a smile out of him. But nope, he just kept miming a rope and pulling it.  Needless to say, there wasn\\'t a second date. But hey, at least I got a good story out of it. And I learned that when someone shows you who they are, believe them. Especially if they\\'re wearing a fedora.'"
