Hey, everyone! How's it going tonight? Good? Yeah, me too. I'm feeling great. I just got back from a trip to the dentist, and let me tell you, nothing makes you feel more alive than having someone drill into your skull.

You know what else makes me feel alive? Online shopping. I love it. But I hate when you're trying to buy something and the website asks you to create an account. Like, no, I don't want to create an account. I just want to buy this one thing and never think about it again. I don't need another username and password to forget.

Speaking of forgetting things, have you ever walked into a room and immediately forgot why you went in there? It's like your brain is playing a trick on you. "Hey, go get that thing." "Okay, brain, got it." walks into room "Wait, what was I supposed to get again?" And then you stand there, feeling like an idiot, trying to retrace your steps and figure out what the hell you were doing.

But you know what's worse than forgetting why you went into a room? Forgetting your own name. That's happened to me before. I was at a party, and this guy came up to me and was like, "Hey, what's your name?" And I just froze. Like, I knew my name, but for some reason, I couldn't remember it in that moment. So I just said the first thing that came to mind: "Um, my name is...Greg." And then I had to spend the rest of the night pretending to be a guy named Greg.

Anyway, that's all from me tonight. Thanks for coming out, and remember: if you forget your own name, just go with Greg. It seems to work pretty well.
