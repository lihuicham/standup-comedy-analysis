Hey everyone, great to be here tonight! So I recently got married, and let me tell you, marriage is a lot like a game of Jenga. You start off with this solid foundation, and then you start adding pieces one by one. But if you make one wrong move, the whole thing can come crashing down.

And don't even get me started on arguments. My wife and I argue about everything. The other day, we were arguing about whether or not our dog understands English. I mean, I swear the dog knows what I'm saying. But my wife is convinced that he's just responding to my tone of voice. So I decided to test her theory. I started saying really mean things to the dog in a happy tone of voice, like "You're a terrible dog, you're the worst dog ever!" And you know what? He wagged his tail and jumped up on me like I was giving him a treat. So I guess my wife was right. But now I'm worried that the dog thinks I'm a complete jerk.

But you know what really stresses me out? Holidays. Specifically, buying gifts for people. I mean, who came up with this whole gift-giving thing? It's like, "Hey, let me spend a bunch of money on something you may or may not like, and you can do the same for me." And don't even get me started on wrapping paper. Who has the time and patience to wrap gifts perfectly? I just throw some tape on it and call it a day. But then my wife insists on making it look all pretty, like it's going to win an award for best-wrapped gift or something. It's just a waste of time and paper, if you ask me.

Anyway, that's all from me tonight, folks. Thanks for coming out and have a great night!
